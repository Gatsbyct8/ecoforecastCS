# EcoForecast:
##  A Scalable and Secure Cyberinfrastructure for the Repeatability of Ecological Research

### Motivation:
Ecosystems are essential to human health and well-being, for example by protecting watersheds, pollinating agricultural crops and buffering the atmosphere against rising CO2 concentrations. Yet, these services are increasingly threatened by human activity. As the Earth rapidly moves outside the envelope of historical environmental conditions, it is increasingly urgent that ecologists be able to provide managers and policymakers with quantitative projections that appropriately account for and quantify sources of forecast uncertainty.

### Project Overview:
This projects aim to analyse and automate procedures to make ecological forecasts and update these forecasts over time as new data become available. To enhance access to the forecasts to other researchers, as well as to allow other researchers to 'compete' against our own forecasts, we aim to build a scalable, cloud-based system for submitting, generating, archiving, and disseminating multi-model ecological forecasts. Beyond advancing ecological research and socially-useful forecasts, this system will contribute to the more general development of a scalable and secure cyberinfrastructure for automated, repeatable scientific analyses applied to real-time data.


EcoForecast aims to support ecology research by providing state of the art cloud based infrastructure facility for the ecological forecasts.
